<p><b>Linear Equations</b></p>

<p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
<div>
  <p id="l1">ax + b = 0 </p> 
</div>
 <p>where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. 
 This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation.
 Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
 Also, the variable may or may not be an <span>x</span> so donâ€™t get too 
 locked into always seeing an <span>x</span> there.</p>

<p><b>Quadratic Equation</b></p>

<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
<div>
 <p id="l1"> ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 </p> 
</div>
<p>where <span>a, b, c</span> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span> a</span> can't be 0.</p>

<p><b>The area of a circle (A)</b></p>

<p><span>&#960</span> (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:,</p>
<div>
 <p id="l1"> A = &#960 &#215 r<sup>2</sup></p>  
</div>
<p>or, when you know the diameter (<span>D</span>):</p>
<div>
<p id="l1">A =(&#960 / 4) &#215 D<sup>2</sup> </p> 
</div>
<p>or, when you know the circumference (<span>C</span>):</p>
<div>
 <p id="l1"> A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &#215 &#960</p> 
</div>>
<p><b>Intersection</b></p>

<p>The intersection of two sets <span>A</span> and <span>B</span>, 
 denoted by A &#8745 B, is the set of all objects that are members of both 
 the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
<div>
  <p id="l1">A &#8745 B = { x : x &#8712 A and x &#8712 B }</p>  
</div>
<p>That is, <span>x</span> is an element of the intersection 
    A &#8745 B if and only if <span>x</span> is both an element of <span>A</span> and an element of <span>B</span>.
