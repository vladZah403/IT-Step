    <p> <h1>Vehicle</h1></p>

        <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><a href="#l1">[1]</a></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo.
         Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), 
         railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle,
         hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup><a href="#l2">[2]</a></sup></p>
        
         <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive 
         forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
         for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><a href="#l3">[3]</a></sup></p>
